about: "Problem\r\n\r\n10% of ALL children present with a language disorder affecting\
  \ how they express wants, needs and ideas. It is more common than autism or ADHD.\
  \ Research shows that children with language difficulties are motivated by tech\
  \ but rarely exposed to it in therapy.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nWe aimed to digitise\
  \ a therapy approach known as word-webs which is well researched and has been popular\
  \ since the 70s. It is based on mind-mapping principles, i.e. strengthening the\
  \ link between word sound and meaning. Tech enables multi-sensory learning, easier\
  \ sharing, greater accessibility."
